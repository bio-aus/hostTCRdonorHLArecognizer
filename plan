This program consists of the following components:

1. Proteosomal Cleavage Program
  

2. Host HLA Binding and TCR Activation Predictor

-Are we using NetMHC, NetMHCpan (neural nets) or MHCFlurry (ensemble machine learning)? Maybe we should implement those

   We need to know if host HLA (hHLA) will bind to these donor HLA (dHLA) proteasomes

   We need to know if TCR will be activated by these dHLA proteasomes

   - Maybe cross reference hHLA for proteasomes that are already deleted during VDL recombination in host

3. Retreive sequences for TCR that are activated
