This program consists of the following components:

1. Proteasomal Cleavage Program
  chops donor HLA into proteasomal cleavage products



2. Host HLA Binding and TCR Activation Predictor

Determines what hHLA will bind to and which TCR's will be activated


-Are we using NetMHC, NetMHCpan (neural nets) or MHCFlurry (ensemble machine learning)? Maybe we should implement those

   We need to know if host HLA (hHLA) will bind to these donor HLA (dHLA) proteasomes

   We need to know if TCR will be activated by these dHLA proteasomes

   - Maybe cross reference hHLA for proteasomes that are already deleted during VDL recombination in host


3. Retreive sequences for TCR that are activated
